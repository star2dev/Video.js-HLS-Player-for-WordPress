= Video.js HLS Player Plugin Usage =

In order to embed a video create a new post/page and use the following shortcode:

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8"]`

Here, "url" is the location of the HLS video package file.

= Video Shortcode Options =

The following options are supported in the shortcode.

**MP4**

You can specify an MP4 video file in addition to the source HLS video file. This parameter is optional.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" mp4="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4"]`

**WebM**

You can specify a WebM video file in addition to the source HLS video file. This parameter is optional.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" webm="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.webm"]`

**Ogv**

You can specify a Ogv video file in addition to the source HLS video file. This parameter is optional.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" ogv="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.ogv"]`

**Width**

Defines the width of the video file (Height is automatically calculated). This option is not required unless you want to limit the maximum width of the video.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" width="480"]`

**Preload**

Specifies if and how the video should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to "auto" (the video should be loaded entirely when the page loads). Other options:

* "metadata" - only metadata should be loaded when the page loads
* "none" - the video should not be loaded when the page loads

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" preload="metadata"]`

**Controls**

Specifies if video controls should be displayed. Defaults to "true". In order to hide controls set this parameter to "false".

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" controls="false"]`

When you disable controls users will not be able to interact with your videos. So It is recommended that you enable autoplay for a video with no controls.

**Autoplay**

Causes the video file to automatically play when the page loads.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" autoplay="true"]`

**Poster**

Defines image to show as placeholder before the video plays.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" poster="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/poster.jpg"]`

**Loop**

Causes the video file to loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" loop="true"]`

**Muted**

Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted.

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" muted="true"]`

**iOS Inline**

Force the video to play inline on iOS 10+

`[videojs_hls url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/xxxxxxxxx.m3u8" inline="true"]`
